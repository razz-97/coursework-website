# Front End Web Development Website Assignment

## _THIS PROJECT IS BEST VIEWABLE ON GOOGLE CHROME_

## Used Testing
#### Proposed Audience for this website is 14-50 year olds. User testing was done within this age range too.

1. 
- [x] On 30th Nov 2017 - after doing some user testing with my sibiling, I found out that the location of my navigation links in my nav bar were not correclty placed. Also the logo wasn't looking good in the position it was in. On 30th Nov, changed to this were made in order to make it look better.

2. 

- [x]  On 30th Nov 2017 - the landing page image was changed. As well as the user testing with my sibling, my dad also user tested the website. From both testers, I found that the image was not appealing and had a dark effect to the site. Therefore, I changed the image to something a bit more brighter and appealing to the audience.

3.

- [x] 24th December 2017 - user testing with a friend showed a minor css bug which caused a spacing between a image and a "section" tag. This was identified during user testing and was fixed.


## Problem which were solved 
1. The spacing problem which was identified during user testing I couldn't solve. But a simpel change to a CSS during late December fixed this problem.

## Wire Frames

These can be found in the ""Wireframes" folder in the project. The desktop version of this site had 3 wireframe drawings. Three difference designs were designed out of which 1 had to be chosen. Once the desktop version was chosen, I drew a mobile version wireframe. These helped me a lot during programming the website. A basis of what the website should look like was given through these drawings.
